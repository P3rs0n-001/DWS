## Introduction
I started this project because I wanted to learn how to make a desktop application in the C language. In this project I've used the curl library for API requests, and the GTK library to make it an actual desktop application.

## To Do
- Make it have embed fiels;
- Make error messages;
- Make it so that fields can be empty;
- Make it use color;
- Make it send images;

## Select an OS
- [Linux based](linux.md)
- [Windows](windows.md)
